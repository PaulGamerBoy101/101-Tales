# 101 Tales is a Fork of the Web Browser Ninetails Made by Github User "MystPi"
> <b>Notice:</b> Not Every Instance of "Ninetails" in the Browser has Been Switched over to "101 Tales" Yet!

"101 Tales" is a Fork of Ninetails, a private, fast, and beautiful web browser that's created with Electron and styled with Tailwind CSS. Enjoy a clean and unique experience while surfing the web.

In this age where many browsers track their users, it's nice to have a break from telemetry and browse privately. "101 Tales never collects any data, and is 100% telemetry free!

I Hope to Add New Features to "101 Tales", as of Now the Only thing Different From Ninetails is a New Logo, Color Scheme & Home Page.
