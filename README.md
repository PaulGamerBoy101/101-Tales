"101 Tales" is a Fork of Ninetails, a private, fast, and beautiful web browser that's created with Electron and styled with Tailwind CSS. Enjoy a clean and unique experience while surfing the web.

In this age where many browsers track their users, it's nice to have a break from telemetry and browse privately. "101 Tales never collects any data, and is 100% telemetry free!

I Hope to Add New Features to "101 Tales", as of Now the Only thing Different From Ninetails is a New Color Sceme & Home Page.
